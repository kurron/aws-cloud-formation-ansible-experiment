# Overview
This project is an experiment to see how a [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) created stack 
can be provisioned by [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) as it is constructed.  An example use case is to create
an [LVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_Volume_Manager_(Linux)) partition from the attached 
[EBS](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/) volumes and format it for use.
